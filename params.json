It aims in bridging different data domains and in integrating different approaches to data analysis and post-processing.\r\n\r\n* [IAP](http://openimageanalysisgroup.github.io/IAP)\r\n\r\n### MCCCS\r\nIt is a generalized, script-based classification system for processing various kinds of image data. Due to the modular design, individual processing-components can be easily adapted, extended or exchanged by other external commands. \r\n\r\n* [MCCCS](http://openimageanalysisgroup.github.io/IAP)\r\n\r\n### ICCS\r\nICCS provides tools and methods for image color correction based on a color chart. This includes the color chart detection and several methods for image color correation using machine learning approaches.\r\n\r\n* [ICCS](http://openimageanalysisgroup.github.io/IAP)",
